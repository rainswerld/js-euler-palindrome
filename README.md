# JavaScript Double-Base Palindrome Challenge

In this challenge, you will complete [Project Euler
\#36](https://projecteuler.net/problem=36). Project Euler is a collection of
math problems that can be solved in many programming languages. It's a useful
website for practicing whiteboarding, or for mastering the basics of the
programming languages you know or want to learn.

## Prerequisites

- [ga-wdi-boston/js-array-iteration-methods](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-iteration-methods)
- [ga-wdi-boston/js-array-iteration-methods-diagnostic](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-iteration-methods-diagnostic)
- ["Counting in Binary" from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Counting_in_binary)

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies.
1. Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Work in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). A pull request is not required,
but it is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

> The decimal number, 585, is 1001001001 in binary, and is palindromic in both
> bases.
>
> Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in
> base 10 and base 2.
>
> (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include
> leading zeros.)
>
> – from [Problem 36 - Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=36)

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors.

## Bonus

Find a multi-digit palindrome in three bases: decimal, binary, and octal.
